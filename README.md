# Tasker_Data_Exercises

This is a data exercise test I took for the Data Analyst position at TaskRabbit. Unfortuantely, I didn't get the role, but I thought it would be a waste for my work to just stay on my hard drive. I've uploaded it to Github to showcase the depth of my knowledge of Pandas (python package) and my analytical skills.

You can see the prompt and questions they ask in "exercise.txt"

The entire data sample is found in "sample.csv"

And you can find the questions, my answers, and data analysis work in "submission.ipynb"
