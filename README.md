# Tasker_Data_Exercises

This is a data exercise test I took for the Data Analyst position at TaskRabbit. Unfortuantely, I didn't get the role, but I thought it would be a waste for my work to just stay on my hard drive. I've uploaded it to Github to showcase the depth of my knowledge of Pandas (python package) and my analytical skills.
